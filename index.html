        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I have been swimming since I was 3 years old.  At the age of 7, I joined a swim team called San Ramon Valley Aquatics (SRVA swimming).  I began competing against other teams in my state, and at the age of 10, I joined another swim team called Pleasanton Seahawks, a gold medal swim team.  There, I practice 5 days a week for 1.5 hours each day, Monday through Friday.  Now I am working to qualify for bigger competitions such as the Junior Olympics, or Far Western.  That's why swimming is my favorite hobby.</p>
